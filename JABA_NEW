Changes to beta7:

DELETE THE SETTINGSFILE BEFORE USING THIS NEW VERSION!
I had to do some changes in that section for a few advantages.

Improvements:
- InfoPopper now contains the JABA icon.
- Status everytime, when dropping items.
- Removed the typos in the built-in english-locale.
- Improved direct disc copying: JABA takes care that the reading device is a bit faster than the writing one - automaticly.
- Localized the Cdrecord info as far as I could.
- Improved the "First-start-setup" once again.

News:
- Main window opens there, where it was closed before - but it's zoomed to minimum.
- Cancel button in drop-Statuswindow - does not work on big single folders (like 'home').
- Added Blank option "Unclose last session", which removes the fixation of the last session of a multisession-disc.
- Projects folder is now per default /boot/home/config/settings/JABA_Projects
	JABA creates a link to it from JABA folder - if you want.
- Standard project folder path costumizable.
- Direct-copy now also for Audio
- New settings - "Other":
	Tooltips on/off
	InfoPopper on/off
	Allow full width for the main window
	Own Projectpath
	Create Link from project folder to JABA' folder on/off
- Added funny easter-egg(s)
