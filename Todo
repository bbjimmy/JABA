make settingsview a stackview and build all type views on launch. This will fix the tooltip issues.
have the settingsview type view check the tooltip flag on activation of the view.


if tooltip then
tooltip widget$, widgetstring$
else
tooltip widget$, ""
endif

The only view that needs to change from this is the one with the tiiltip checkbox. It needs to be changed on set / unset of the checkbox.
